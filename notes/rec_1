Python concepts and questions session (useful? maybe when homework gets harder)
Python
    Used for web development, all sorts of other things
    Interpreted language - no compiling, an interpreter executs programs right away

Operations
    +,- what you'd expect
    * multiplies
    ** exponentials (not ^)
    / division, will do interesting things to pure integers (usually turns them into floats)
    % returns the remainder of 2 divided integers, useful for various things 

Strings
    use 'a' or "a" (no functional difference, let's you embed quotes in a string)

Input
    variable = input('prompt')
    Allows us to collect information from a user through a prompt

Types
    Type functions
        answer_int = int(answer)
        answer_str = str(answer)
        etc.
    Booleans - True/False statements (note capitalization!)
    None - placeholder basically, will use later
    List, tuple, dictionary - divisible data types to be covered later

Operands
    <,> works as expected
    <=,>= also works as expected, note the syntax though
    != is not equal to
    == is equal to
    and, or - takes 2 operands and evaluates whether they are both or one is true
    not - takes 1 operand, if that thing is not true/opposite
    Note: need of () in some cases to combine these things correctly
        ex. a = True
            b = True
            c = False
            (a and b) or c >>> True

Control structures
    if, elif, else - branches
    for i in range(1,10) - will run i values 1 through 10 for a loop
    while <condition> - will loop code as long as some condition is met, useful when we don't know
                        how many iters
